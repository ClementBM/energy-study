    Actual Generation

    Generation data aggregated by sector and produced per group (in MW) on an intradaily basis for net generation injected into the network. This data is produced by RTE using remote measurement facilities with which production units are equipped, and using an estimate model for the wind-power and photovoltaic sectors. Hydraulic stocks for France are the aggregated weekly fill rates of reservoirs and lake-type hydraulic storage plants; they are expressed in MWh and sent by the generators to RTE.  # noqa: E501
